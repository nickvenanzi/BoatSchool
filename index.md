## Boat School

Boat School is an iOS App made for anyone finding themselves preparing for a U.S. Coast Guard License Exam. Split into general sections, such as Refrigeration, Safety, and Electricity, users can select any section to study from.

Once a section is selected, the app allows users to select from subsections within a given section. Once selected, questions from that subsection will appear in a scroll content view with two main modes:

1. Study Mode - for those looking to just let telepathic osmosis take over 5 mins before the exam, answers are revealed to questions.
2. Quiz Mode - an interactive mode where users get to guess the correct answer to each question, allowing as many guesses as it takes to get the right answer. Once every question in a section is answered, the quiz results will appear on the user's initial guess to each question.

Beyond these two general modes, there is also a controllable tab on the main section view allowing user's to filter questions to just exclusively 3 A/E questions, or keep it unfilitered to the full 14k question bank.

As a final feature to ease the study grind, a search feature has been implemented based off of key words. Questions and answers containing each of the words in the search bar will appear in 'Study Mode' as a search result.

Enjoy!
